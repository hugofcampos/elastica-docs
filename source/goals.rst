The main objective behind making the documentation is to have a single space where people can at least initiate using the Elastica library. 

Elastica is a wonderful PHP client to interact with the Elasticsearch engine which has been around since a long time and gained popularity in the community.

But, unfortunately the library suffers from lack of documentation and tutorials to get people to use it to its full potential.

	This is an unofficial document written purely on the basis of my understanding of Elastica and Elasticsearch itself.
