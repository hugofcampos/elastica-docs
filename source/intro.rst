Introduction
============

Elastica was in 2010 one of the first PHP clients for elasticsearch and was initially built for elasticsearch v0.16.0 and before. Since then a lot of things have changed in the elasticsearch API. Filter, facets, aggregations and more were added which also added complexity on the client side.

In 2013 elasticsearch decided to unify all its elasticsearch client to have a common base and started to build elasticsearch-php. Since then, both clients are developing in parallel.
